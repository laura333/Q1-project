/*
  Objects provide a way to help organize complex logic.
  We use them to define blueprints about data, such
  as a Car object. Each car can share properties like
  number of wheels and color, but the individual cars
  themselves can have different properties.

  This file shows how to create a simple Cat object
  as well as defining instances of that object.
