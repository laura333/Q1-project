    <p class="lead">I'm in a career transition, and I'm excited about learning something new and putting it to use. I want to live life, explore, discover and have the means to do so. I want to enjoy my work and the people I spend time with each day. I want to feel accomplished and proud of the work that I do, and there's something so satisfying about building something and seeing it live. I like web design and development for that reason among others. I have an eye for layout and design, and I want to learn how to incorporate those elements in my code so it has the look and feel I want it to have. I'd like to work in the wine industry managing websites and/or creating apps for food &amp; wine pairing, cellar management, etc. Ideally, I'll work from home and have flexibility in my schedule to be able to pursue my passion for acting as well.</p>
